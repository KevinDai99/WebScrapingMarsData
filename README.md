# webscraping-Challenge11

In the weekly challenge, I honed my webscrapping skills with the beautiful soup library. In particular, the focus was on:

1) Scrapping the summary and titles from "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html"
2) Scrapping a table from "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html"
3) Analyze the contents of the table via Pandas to gain insights on Mars 

* Although Pandas as a function to automatically scrape tables, I used beautiful soup as a means to practice.
